# Image Processing and Computer Vision

[OpenCV Github](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

Image processing and Computer Vision are very active and rewarding fields of computer science. For Humans, the use of eyes helped them carry forward mankind.
For a simple organism, being able to observe its surroundings is the most crucial step for evolution.

If we helped computers realize similar traits to observe their surrounding and act accordingly. A lot of complex problems can be simplified, for eg.  Assisted Driving ( or complete autonomous), Precision Surgery, Image Colorization, Image Repair, Image Stitching, etc.

This field is very adventurous but only sticking to API calls of the library would not benefit in the long run. Itâ€™s highly recommended to have a basic understanding of the Maths behind for better use and decision making in future.

## OpenCV Installation

The easiest way to get started is with the help of python. You can simply ``pip3 install`` the opencv package or build your own version. Although OpenCV is primarily built upon C++, the Python language exists as a binder. Hence the performance in Python and C++ are very close (**High use of Python functions and loops may lower performance**)

- [OpenCV Installation Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html)

Getting started with Python with pre-built binaries are recommended for beginners. Using C++ with OpenCV gives a deep access to OpenCV.

## Image Processing

Image processing is Computing technique to manipulate Matrix that contain the intensity values for different color spaces. Understanding how images are actually stored in computer is very necessary.

## Machine Learning and Image Processing

The use of Machine Learning to Extract freatures from Image is the key step towards Computer vision.
