## What is Flutter
 
Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).
Flutter consists of two important parts:

- An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).

- A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.

To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.

If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.

Flutter is now the top 11 software repos based on GitHub stars. Moreover, weâ€™ve already seen thousands of Flutter apps being published on app stores. One of the most notable examples is the Xianyu app created by the Alibaba team, used by over 50 million people.
