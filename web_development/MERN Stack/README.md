## How to begin 

#### Choose a Code Editor

One can do Web Development on any code editor be it Visual Studio, Atom, Sublime etc.

It is recommended to use Visual Studio Code, the setup for the same can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html)

    Download & Setup IDE

## What is HTML
 
- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
- It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages designed to be displayed in a web browser.
- Web browsers receive HTML documents and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
- It describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
- Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

(Documentation is the official way to learn the technology so no need to go through it if you have already followed the steps before it! It is great for when you get stuck somewhere.)**

## What is CSS
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

## What is JavaScript
- JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, functional programming styles.
- JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
- Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java".

## What is Bootstrap
- Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins.
- Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs

## What is React
React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM.

## What is Redux
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to (and inspired by) Facebook's Flux architecture.

## What is Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

## Best Node.js Course for beginners (ACM Suggestion)
- [Node Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/)
- It is highly recommended to follow the projects listed below after completing the basics of Node.js

## The Journey has Just begun


Congratulations on making it this far! Learning Web development is a never ending process new technologies are coming up everyday, but that's what makes it interesting. What we have covered so far will help any new engineer to ACM thapar's Web and App Dev Team to get up to speed with our technologies pretty quickly. There are many more things to be learnt, but building up a solid foundation in the essentials will aid in learning the rest of the technologies.
