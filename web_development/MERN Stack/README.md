## What is JavaScript
- JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, functional programming styles.
- JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.
- Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java".
