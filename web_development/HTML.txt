#What is HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages designed to be displayed in a web browser.
Web browsers receive HTML documents and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
It describes the structure of a Web page
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. 
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
