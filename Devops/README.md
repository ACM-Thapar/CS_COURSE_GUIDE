## What is DevOps?
- DevOps can be explained simply as operations working together with engineers to get things done faster in an automated and repeatable way.
> You can ask 10 people for a definition of DevOps and likely get 10 different answers.
- The term DevOps is a combination of two words namely Development and Operations. DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, that is, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- The ultimate goal of DevOps is to decrease the duration of the systemâ€™s development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close synchronization with business objectives.
- DevOps is a software development approach with the help of which you can develop superior quality software quickly and with more reliability. It consists of various stages such as continuous development, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring.
