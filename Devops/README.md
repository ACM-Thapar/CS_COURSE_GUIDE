## What is DevOps?
![This is a alt text.](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmiro.medium.com%2Fmax%2F3964%2F1*9pVLG4BzEWIcMnfhFp9ULQ.png&f=1&nofb=1 "Continuous Development")
- DevOps can be explained simply as operations working together with engineers to get things done faster in an automated and repeatable way.
> You can ask 10 people for a definition of DevOps and likely get 10 different answers.
- The term DevOps is a combination of two words namely Development and Operations. DevOps is a practice that allows a single team to manage the entire application development life cycle, that is, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.
- The ultimate goal of DevOps is to decrease the duration of the system’s development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close synchronization with business objectives.
- DevOps is a software development approach with the help of which you can develop superior quality software quickly and with more reliability. It consists of various stages such as continuous development, continuous integration, continuous testing, continuous deployment, and continuous monitoring.

### DevOps Practices
#### 1. Continuous Development
- This is the phase that involves planning and coding of the software. You decide the project vision during the planning phase and the developers begin developing the code for the application.

#### 2. Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Integration (CI) is a DevOps practice in which developers frequently merge their code changes to the central repository. Then, the code is built automatically and automated tests are run against the built code.
#### 3. Continuous Delivery (CD)
-  Continuous Delivery (CD) is the automation of steps to safely get changes into production. Where Continuous Deployment focuses on the actual deployment, Continuous Delivery focuses on the release and release strategy.

#### 4. Continuous Deployment 
- This is the stage where you deploy the code on the production servers. It is also important to ensure that you correctly deploy the code on all the servers.

#### 5. Continuous Testing
- This is the stage where you test the developed software continuously for bugs using automation testing tools.
- The Continuous Testing practice helps to identify potential risks as early as possible in all stages of the development lifecycle to minimize the impact on end-users.
#### 6. Continuous Monitoring
- This is a very critical stage of the DevOps life cycle where you continuously monitor the performance of your application. Here you record vital information about the use of the software. You then process this information to check the proper functionality of the application. You resolve system errors such as low memory, server not reachable, etc in this phase.

#### 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- IaC is a DevOps practice that involves the use of a configuration management tool to manage the infrastructure.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice where infrastructure—virtual machines, load balancers, networks, etc.—are configured and managed using code rather than manually setting up and managing those resources. This has become an essential DevOps practice in organizations who specifically have moved to cloud platforms.

#### 8. Microservices
- A microservice is a small, independent, self-contained application that is designed to be deployed in a distributed environment.
- Unlike in traditional monolithic architectures, in microservices architecture, a single application is built as a set of small services or components. These separate services have their own functionality and their communication happens through a lightweight interface or an API.
