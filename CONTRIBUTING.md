# Welcome to the contributions of CS_COURSE_GUIDE

## Before contributing

Before contributing, please ensure you have **read the complete guidelines**. If there are any doubts please open an issue, and clearly state your concerns


## We follow a systematic Git Workflow -

- Create a fork of this repo.
- Clone your fork of your repo on your pc.
- [Add Upstream to your clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
- **Every change** that you do, it has to be on a branch. Commits on master would directly be closed.
- Create a new branch to fix a issue . Make required no. of commits .**Make sure you write proper commit messages**.
- Push the branch to the origin tremote and make a pull request .
- Make sure that before you create a new branch for new changes,[syncing with upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) is neccesary.

### Commit Guidelines

- All commits are to be on a branch. Any on master will be closed
- It is mandated that your branch is in [sync with upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork), before you create a PR
- If your PR is to fix an issue, make sure it contain's GitHub's [keyword reference](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests), which closes the related issue on PR merge
- If changes are made to your PR, before merge(new commits to fix minor issues, like a failing Travis build), please [squash](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git) your commits, so you don't have an absurd number of them
- If your commit is for a UI change, it would be **awesome** if you add a screenshot, or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out, in your PR. Makes it easy to review and merge
- Write [clear, meaningful](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) git commits
  - We recommend that changes be grouped locally with semantic prefixes to make it easier to understand, but not mandated. For example:
