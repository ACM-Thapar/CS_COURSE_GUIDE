How can I start to learn Web Development ?

How can I start learning web development? Is it easy? And how can I keep up with the latest web designing technologies?
These are the questions that appear in every beginner’s mind. There is also confusion between web designing and web development, but we’ll talk about web development.

It totally depends on how much you are interested in and are serious about it. if you desperately wanted to learn then you can easily be an expert on it. There’s nothing like it’s so hard or something like it’s so difficult to design websites like we use or look around our day-to-day life. e.g: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and many more.

Stages to follow:

Stage 1 – HTML: HTML, you have heard about it lots of times before. If I am not wrong HTML is the language you have learned in your school life. Yes, it’s actually the same as what you have learned a long time ago but as long as time changes technologies are changes. Nowadays as you have grown up, even HTML has been grown up too, now there is called HTML5 which comes into existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just said that as we have grown up HTML has grown up too but the difference between us and HTML is, it changed its name to HTML5. In HTML5, you can not just prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have many more things that we can do. We can store and process values on variables on-page itself without any databases as we do in any programming languages (Temporary variables), we can develop games on it. No need for the flash to play animations on it. Even we can develop a fully functional blog with HTML4 itself without any help to server-side scripting languages.

Stage 2 – CSS: We live in such a society where everybody wants to look pretty, beautiful, to achieve this everyone does makeup. Similarly, CSS does for HTML. CSS creates the beauty on HTML pages. With the help of CSS, you can make your web page colorful and smooth. You can even create animations using CSS. You can add transitions, changing the scrolling events of your pages, mouse click events and many more. But as HTML changes to HTML5, CSS also has been changed to CSS3.

Stage 3 – JAVASCRIPT: You have learned how your site will look like, you have designed the beauty of your page yet. Now, it’s turn to create some useful tasks that your web page elements will do when some activities performed on your web pages like button click events, mouse over any text, playing and pausing some animations on page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT, you can do that easily. One of the best scripting languages used to make a web page more smooth, flexible and platform-independent is javascript. It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an easy level, that will be enough to do your all tasks.

Stage 4 – BOOTSTRAP: Remember the term Responsive ? Okay, let me explain to you what exactly responsive website means. Responsive websites are those sites which change its element’s alignments, spacing according to the screen size of the device it is browsing. This is the technology called Bootstrap which makes it easier to design a responsive web site. Bootstrap is an open-source front end framework that works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design responsive web sites for your laptops, tablets and mobile devices.

Stage 5 – PHP: As up to now you have learned about how your web page will look like, how the interface of your web page users will face. How it reacts based upon the user’s activity but only at the client machine. But nowadays we have the works of a lot perform on the back end of our web page called server. So to code on server-side we need server-side scripting language which one is PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor). We have also many more other server-side scripting languages are there like Asp.net, JSP etc but PHP is one of the easiest and most used server-side scripting languages.

How to Run PHP program on your local machine? As PHP is a server-side scripting language it must have a server to run? So how can you do that? Surely you can not afford a server to learn PHP. So don’t worry about it. We have a lot of tools available in the IT market which helps you to run PHP codes on your local machine. Following tools can be used to run PHP codes on local machine :

WAMP(Windows, Apache MySQL, PHP) – For windows machines
LAMP(Linux, Apache, My-Sql, PHP) – For Linux based machines
XAMP(X-for any OS, Apache, My-Sql, PHP) – It can work on any OS

Stage 6 – MySQL: Now it comes to databases, We have so many data available to display on the web page but we just can’t simply store them on web pages. A database management system is important because it manages data efficiently and allows users to perform multiple tasks with ease. A database management system stores organizes and manages a large amount of information within a single software application. MY-SQL is one of the open-source database management available in the IT industry. I am recommending learning PHP language instead of ASP and JSP just because it provides easiest way to connect MY-SQL database with it If you have a basic concept of C/C++ Programming languages. Even you can practice the connectivity of PHP and MY-SQL on your local machine with the help of tools discussed above.
