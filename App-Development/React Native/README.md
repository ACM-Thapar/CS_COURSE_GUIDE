## What is React Native
 
React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities .
It is heavily used by most of the companies nowdays becuase of its code-reusability and cross platform feature.



## Development Environment

- Expo : If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started
is with Expo CLI. Expo is a set of tools built around React Native.(For
starting with React Native as the complete beginner I’ll recommend this.)
- React Native cli : You need to setup android studio and install React native
cli.

The complete environment setup related doc can be found at :
https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup



## How to begin

To grasp all the fundamentals of React, you can start with the following tutorials:
- Official doc by react native (I personally recommend you to start from
here) :​ ​ https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started​ ​ After you finish some
basics like View, Text, Stylesheet, and TouchableOpacity , you are good to
go for some basic projects.

        *Try to work on some UI parts more and once you have good command there add
         functionalities.
