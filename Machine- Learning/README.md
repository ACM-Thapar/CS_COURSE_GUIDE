## About

 A guide covering Machine Learning including the applications, libraries and tools that will make you better and more efficient with Machine Learning development

## How to get started with ML?


 
### Baby steps!

 - Get to know Python
 - Learn numpy, matplotlib, pandas for basic data manilupation
 - Deep dive into the world of ML Algorithms

### ML specific Maths requirements :
 - Brush up on some Probability and Statistics 
 - Learn Linear Algebra 
 - Multi variable calculus is a must for deeper understanding
 - Do not be afraid of something that you do not know
 
 
### No math background for ML? Check this out!

Don't stress, just like most of the things in life, you can learn maths! Here are some great beginner and advanced resources to get into machine learning maths. I would suggest starting with these three very important concepts in machine learning (here are 3 awesome free courses available on Khan Academy):

-   [Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)  - Khan Academy
-   [Statistics and probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)  - Khan Academy
-   [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)  - Khan Academy

Here are some great free books and videos that might help you learn in a more "structured approach":

-   [mathematicalmonk](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcAtD_VYwcYwVbTdvArsm7w)  - YouTube
-   [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://gwthomas.github.io/docs/math4ml.pdf)  - Garrett Thomas
-   [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics)](http://fs2.american.edu/alberto/www/analytics/ISLRLectures.html)  - Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

If you still lack mathematical confidence, check out the  [Read books](https://github.com/louisfb01/start-machine-learning#ReadBooks)  section above, where I shared many great books to build a strong mathematical background. You now have a very good math background for machine learning and you are ready to dive in deeper!
