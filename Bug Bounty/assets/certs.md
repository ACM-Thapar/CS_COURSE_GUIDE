## Certifications ðŸ“œ

Quite a lot of beginners ask about certifications and if they can help in Bug Bounty. Similar to Coding itself it is a nice thing to have but not a necessity to be successful.<br>
Due to the fact that a lot more Hunters are trying to get better in different fields, and are curious about the certifications, I wanted to add some Info and Notes about some of them.
